# Text-Web-Application

In this assignment I needed to modify starter code to create an application where we can take notes in a deployed text application. I modified code in our webpack.config.js, and in our js folder under src. The main modifications I had to make were under my database.js file where I had write code for us to be able to add and retrieve our database once we deploy it. Once deployed we can install the application. You can also open the inspect, go under application, IndexedDB, Jate, and view key path id and the value you put into the text application. 



## Github 

On Github I was able to create a new repository where I was able to push all my work to. Before even starting the challenge I had to clone the new repository to the my computer first. I cloned it using my gitbash, from there on any code I worked on visual studio code I was able to save it and push it back to my repository. Once all my work was done I did a final push and created a deployed site. 


## Heroku

For this assignment we had to deploy our application to heroku.  By D\doing a "git push heroku main" I was able to get it deployed.
